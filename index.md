## Hi There!

As part of my Hack Day project for this quarter, I spent some time becoming familiar with Github.
This is about as much as I've managed to achieve.

Although I also managed to create a few additional projects that have no content in them. 
See [Showcase](https://hconnell.github.io/showcase) and [Hack-Day](https://hconnell.github.io/hack-day)


### Things I want to do as I learn more about this stuff
[ ] Add some navigation
[ ] Add some images
[ ] See what else I can do with these pages
[ ] Take a look at some other folks pages to see what they have done.
